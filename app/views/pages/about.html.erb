<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
Minerva Ballet is a new London based amateur adult ballet company with a fresh, professional approach. At Minerva Ballet we aim to bring our dancers from the studio to the stage.  As adult dance students, you will have been taught ballet technique, you may even have become accustomed to a particular method or teacher.  What none of this prepares you for is performance.</p>

<p>All of our teachers have worked internationally as ballet dancers, and are keen to teach amateurs the art of performance.  From the basics of stagecraft, to how to communicate with an audience, and how to deal with mishaps on stage, our teachers’ combined experience will help our dancers step away from the barre and become performers.</p>

<h2>Current Repertoire</h2>
<p>This season we are working on a triple bill.</p>



<p><%= link_to "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBJNc3h7Hp8" do %>
  <strong>Les Sylphides</strong><% end %>  is an iconic, non-narrative ballet, choreographed by Mikhail Fokine.  Orchestrated by Glazunov, the piano music of Chopin sets the scene of ethereal beauty and dreams.  Woodland sylphs dance for a young man, the poet, in the moonlight.   This is a stylised and technically demanding ballet, requiring unfaltering corps de ballet discipline, clean lines, and fluid port de bras.  

The “romantic rêverie” we recognise as Les Sylphides was first performed by Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in the Théâtre du Châtelet in June 1909.  Its soloists were Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova.  The long romantic tutu was designed by Léon Bakst, and inspired by a lithograph of Marie Taglioni as a sylph.</p>

<h3>Tamara Karsavina in Les Sylphides</h3>
<p>This work will challenge our dancers and delight our audience, lulling the latter into a beautiful dream.  It will open our triple bill, and serve as a contrast to the next work, Polovtsian Dances.</p>


<p><%= link_to "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLMbf7E5Uxo" do %>
  <strong>Polovtsian dances</strong><% end %> consists of a series dances from the second act of Borodin’s historical epic opera, Prince Igor.  It is set in the encampment of Khan Kontchak, leader of twelfth century Polovtsian army.  Prince Igor and his son have been captured, and are entertained by the warriors dancing.  
This work demonstrates the versatility, innovation and musicality of Fokine’s choreography.  The Borodin score is as beautiful as it is primal, and conjures up the energy, flamboyance and turbulence of the twelfth century central Asia. 

For our dancers, this will provide a further challenge, and have enlisted the help of a Russian character teaching to ensure a holistic and faithful approach to this work.</p>

<p>Our final piece is <%= link_to "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxMliv0WCNI" do %>
  <strong>Knots</strong>
<% end %>.  This is a collaborative work created by our ballet mistress Sheila and others.  This explores the trials of human relationships.  With a diverse score including Bach, Madness and The Buzzcocks, this is a humorous piece.  Drawing from classical ballet, jazz and contemporary dancing, the choreography is as eclectic as the music.  The juxtaposition of pain and jocularity mirrors the complexity of human nature and interactions.</p>
